The 8x8reg Project
------------------

The 8x8reg project is about using an ATtiny13 to drive a 8x8 LED Matrix,
using the MAX7219 chip. This is a "utility" project, designed to display
8 x 8 bit status information.

The data is sent to the '13 on one wire using a Manchester biphase
encoded signal. 12 bits are sent: 4 bits selecting a zero-based row
(0-7), and 8 bits of LED data.

Debugging ATtinys can be difficult, especially in assembly language.
This project is designed to allow your code in another Tiny send data to
be displayed using only one output pin. In this way, you can display up
to 64 bits of information, or 8 bytes worth.

In addition to only requiring one output pin, SENDING Manchester biphase
is very easy to bit bang out of the sending host, using a minimum of
code (and thus not disrupt the environment being debugged too much).

Once the receiver and matrix are built into some kind of utility
cabinet, you only need to link your ATtiny* being debugged with a small
sending routine. Then make calls to it, whenever you want a byte
displayed on a particular row of the destination matrix. All this
happens using one wire from the host to the matrix.

The receiver is designed to receive signals at varying speeds. The
receiver expects one initial zero bit, which is used as a start bit
after the line sits idle (high). The zero bit is timed, so that it
knows how long each half bit time is. From this, the receiver can
adapt to any reasonable sending speed.

Should the sending signal be too irregular to be received, the matrix
will display a fault code and other trace information. See the end
of the module 8x8rx.S for more details.

While the receiver is flexible, extremely slow signals will overflow
its counters and fault. Likewise, if you attempt to send the signal
too quickly, the receiver's state machine will also fault.
