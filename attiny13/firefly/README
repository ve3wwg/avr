Firefly Jar

This code is written in avr-gcc assembly language (not for AVR-Studio).
It  is intended to drive up to 5 LEDs inside a "firefly jar", driven by
a PDIP-8 ATtiny13A. The fireflys light up randomly, each driven by their
own state machine, with varying brightness using software PWM.

The software PWM is driven from one hardware Timer 0, which updates the
software counters and PWM state in an ISR routine.

After the fireflys put on a light show for about 1.5 hours (configurable
in source code), the ATtiny13A is put into power down mode, consuming 
only a microamp or two.  Operating under these conditions, once per
night, a pair of NiCAD 600 mAh batteries should last a week before
needing a recharge.
